# Office operation skills are replaced by Office tools

English | [中文](guide.zh.md)

## Change

`@lyness/lyn-skill-office` no longer registers the `office-render`, `office-recalculate`, and `office-export-pdf` skills; it registers the `office` router and the `office-docx`, `office-pptx`, and `office-xlsx` authoring skills. After an Office skill loads, the model calls [`office_render`, `office_convert`, and `office_recalculate`](../../../../packages/document/tool-office/README.md) from the following step.

Configuration changes:

| Removed | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `skill-office` keys `node` and `cli` | None; Office tools convert in the Host |
| `LYNESS_BUNDLED_OFFICE_CLI` and `LYNESS_BUNDLED_OFFICE_NODE` | None; no component reads them |
| `LYNESS_BUNDLED_PRIMARY_RUNTIME` | `LYNESS_PRIMARY_RUNTIME` |

`skill-office` gains `pythonEnvironment`. Its default, `'workspace-dependencies'`, directs the Python skills to `load_workspace_dependencies`; a composition without `@lyness/lyn-tool-workspace-dependencies` must set `'user'`. [Office skill resources](../office-skill-resources/guide.md) covers the removal of `LYNESS_BUNDLED_OFFICE_SKILLS`.

The Office tools parse untrusted documents with the native LibreOffice Kit engine in the Host process, outside the shell sandbox and PTC permissions, with the Host user's permissions; the filesystem backend still authorizes inputs. The `office-kit` row gains `outputDirectory` (default `$LYNESS_HOME/office-kit/outputs`), `outputRetentionMs`, and `maxOutputStoreBytes`.

The Web profile, and the SDK profile without a primary runtime, list the Office skills in the first request context and `/` menu.

This affects users and prompts of the removed skills, compositions and launchers setting the removed keys or variables, `assetRoot` skill copies, saved `standard` or `ptc` presets, deployments relying on the shell sandbox for document parsing, and tests pinning the first request context or `/` menu.

## Migration

1. Replace each removed skill with loading `office` and calling the matching tool:
   - `office-render`: `office_render`;
   - `office-recalculate`: `office_recalculate` with `format: "xlsx"` or `"ods"`;
   - `office-export-pdf`: `office_convert` with `format: "pdf"`.
2. Remove `node` and `cli` from every `skill-office` row in `cordis.yml`, patches, and overlays. Set `pythonEnvironment: user` unless the composition mounts `@lyness/lyn-tool-workspace-dependencies`.
3. Compositions that mount `@lyness/lyn-skill-office` without the shipped bundles also mount `@lyness/lyn-office-kit` and `@lyness/lyn-tool-office`.
4. In launchers, stop setting `LYNESS_BUNDLED_OFFICE_CLI` and `LYNESS_BUNDLED_OFFICE_NODE`, and rename `LYNESS_BUNDLED_PRIMARY_RUNTIME` to `LYNESS_PRIMARY_RUNTIME`. The Python SDK prefers a set or inherited `LYNESS_PRIMARY_RUNTIME`, even empty, over its download cache; unset it to use the cache.
5. In a copy referenced by `assetRoot`, replace the four remaining folders with the installed package's `assets/` and delete the three removed skill folders.
6. A `standard` or `ptc` preset saved from the Agent Preset editor replaces the shipped plugin list, so its Sessions lack the Office tools. Add this row to the saved list, or to `config.plugins` of the `preset-standard` or `preset-ptc` row in `$LYNESS_HOME/profiles/<profile>/cordis.patch.yml` (`<profile>`: `web` or `desktop`):

   ```yaml
   - id: tool-office
     name: '@lyness/lyn-tool-office'
   ```

7. Deployments that require sandboxed document parsing omit `@lyness/lyn-tool-office`.
8. Update expected first request contexts and `/` menus with the Office skills.
9. Confirm: in a new `standard` or `ptc` Session, send `/office`, then a separate PDF export request; it produces an `office_convert` call that returns a temporary PDF path or the `unavailable` message.
